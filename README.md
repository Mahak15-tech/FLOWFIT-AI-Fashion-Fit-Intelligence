# FLOWFIT — AI Fashion Fit Intelligence

> **Know the fit before you wear it.**

FLOWFIT is an AI-powered fashion fit intelligence system that predicts clothing fit using body measurements, garment information, and historical fashion-fit data.

The project uses the **Rent the Runway clothing fit dataset** and combines machine learning, FastAPI, and a premium web interface to provide personalized fit analysis and size guidance.

## ✨ Features

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Fit Prediction**
  Predicts whether a garment is likely to be `Small`, `Fit`, or `Large`.

- 📊 **Fit Confidence**
  Provides the model's prediction confidence and class probabilities.

- 📏 **Personalized Fit Analysis**
  Uses age, height, weight, body type, bust size, garment category, size, rating, and rental purpose.

- 👗 **Size Guidance**
  Provides a recommended size based on the predicted fit.

- ⚠️ **Fit Risk Indicator**
  Converts the fit prediction and confidence into a simple fit-risk level.

- 📈 **Dataset Intelligence**
  Displays dataset statistics, fit distribution, and category distribution.

- 🧠 **Model Lab**
  Displays trained model information and evaluation metrics.

- 🎨 **Premium Fashion UI**
  Luxury editorial-inspired interface with responsive design, animations, and modal-based interactions.

| Logistic Regression | 43.99% | 43.68% |
| Random Forest | **46.04%** | **45.86%** |
| Gradient Boosting | 44.62% | 44.21% |

### Best Model

**Random Forest**

The current model achieved:

- Accuracy: **46.04%**
- Precision: **45.81%**

## 🔌 API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | GET | API information |
| `/api/health` | GET | Health check |
| `/api/predict-fit` | POST | Predict clothing fit |

## 🎯 Example Prediction

FLOWFIT accepts information such as:

```json
{
  "age": 24,
  "height": 165,
  "weight": 58,
  "body_type": "hourglass",
  "bust_size": "34b",
  "category": "dress",
  "size": 8,
  "rating": 5,
  "rented_for": "wedding"
}
```

The system returns:

```json
{
  "fit": "fit",
  "confidence": 62.4,
  "fit_risk": "Low",
  "current_size": 8,
  "recommended_size": 8
}
```

---

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

- FLOWFIT currently predicts clothing **fit**, rather than directly predicting clothing **returns**.
- The size recommendation is currently a heuristic based on the predicted fit.
- The current baseline model has moderate predictive performance, so the system should be treated as an experimental fashion-fit intelligence system rather than a production sizing authority.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Review-text NLP features
- Sentiment and fit-description extraction
- SHAP-based explainability
- LIME explanations
- Advanced ensemble models
- Hyperparameter optimization
- Garment-specific sizing intelligence
- Personalized user profiles
- Historical purchase/rental learning
- Return-probability prediction
